## App Idea:

The current social media models rely heavily on data collection and harvesting to engage users and build their presence. However the data collected is often sold to advertisers to maintain the free status of the app making it ethically dubious. These apps also make use of psychology, enabling each part of their interface to draw a user’s attention and keep them on the app for long periods of time. This user retention often leads to feelings of overwhelmingness and a general fear of missing out among younger audiences. It also fosters an unhealthy competitive atmosphere that leads to negative self-worth and insecurity. Giving up on social media is not a solution to this problem as it has become a vital part of our lives. Instead, people should focus on ethical re-designs of existing apps and constantly re-iterating through this process by getting user feedback. Our proposal aims to use existing research and come up with a new design of Instagram. We list out changes and new features that can be added to make Instagram more social and ethical.
